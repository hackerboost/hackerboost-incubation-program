## 📄 1. `overview.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
To give a **high-level snapshot** of the project — what it is, who it’s for, and why it exists.

### ✅ Should include:
- What the project is
- The key features
- The audience it's built for

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# Project Overview

SusuChain is a decentralized group savings platform built for underserved communities in Africa.

It allows users to create or join susu (rotating savings) groups, contribute funds transparently, and receive payouts on a fixed cycle — all managed by smart contracts without a central administrator.

**Core Features:**
- Trustless contribution cycles
- Auto-managed group payouts
- Transparent transaction history
- Mobile-friendly DApp
```

## 📄 2. `problem-statement.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
Explain the **problem you’re solving** — the pain or inefficiency in the real world.

### ✅ Should include:
- Who the problem affects
- Why current solutions are inadequate

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# Problem Statement

Millions of Africans participate in informal savings groups known as *susu*. These groups are managed manually and often suffer from:

- Lack of transparency
- Mismanagement of funds
- No digital record-keeping
- Organizers disappearing with money

There is no secure and automated way to manage susu groups without trust issues.
```

## 📄 3. `solution.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
Describe **how your project solves the problem** in a unique or effective way.

### ✅ Should include:
- Features of your solution
- Why your approach is better

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# Solution

SusuChain removes the need for human managers by using blockchain-based smart contracts to:

- Automatically collect and manage group funds
- Execute scheduled payouts transparently
- Keep public, tamper-proof contribution records
- Let users join, track, and exit susu groups via a mobile-friendly app

No third-party or admin needed. Just code and transparency.
```

## 📄 4. `architecture.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
Show the **technical structure** of your application — how different components connect and work together.

### ✅ Should include:
- System architecture diagram
- Brief explanation of components

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# System Architecture

The SusuChain DApp has three main components:

1. **Frontend** (React + RainbowKit):  
   Users interact with the DApp, create/join susu groups, and track progress.

2. **Smart Contracts** (Solidity on Arbitrum):  
   Handles group creation, contributions, cycles, and payouts.

3. **Storage**:  
   Contribution history stored on-chain; optional user documents stored on IPFS.

## Diagram:
[Include a diagram created using draw.io or Miro showing the user ↔ frontend ↔ smart contract interactions]
```

## 📄 5. `roadmap.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
List the **future plans** for the project beyond the MVP phase.

### ✅ Should include:
- Short-term (post-demo day)
- Long-term (vision)

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# Project Roadmap

## Q1 – MVP Phase (Incubation)
- [x] Smart contract deployment
- [x] Basic DApp UI
- [ ] Testnet release

## Q2 – Expansion

## 📄 6. `user-flow.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
Describe the **user experience journey** from start to finish.

### ✅ Should include:
- Step-by-step flow
- What users see/do at each stage

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# User Flow

## Flow 1: Creating a Susu Group
1. User connects MetaMask
2. Clicks “Create Group”
3. Enters group name, cycle size, and start date
4. Confirms and signs transaction
5. Group is created and visible on homepage

## Flow 2: Joining a Group
1. Clicks on a group card
2. Views members and contribution info
3. Clicks “Join Group” and signs transaction
4. Added as contributor; payment window starts
```

## 📄 7. `glossary.md`

### 🔹 Purpose:
Define technical or local terms used in your project for **non-technical users, partners, or grant reviewers**.

### ✅ Should include:
- Terms that are technical, regional, or blockchain-specific

### 🧪 Example:
```markdown
# Glossary
